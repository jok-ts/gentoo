  eselect-guile-2.0.ebuild, files/guile.eselect, files/guile.eselect.5:
  Bug fix for the bug fix. This is really embarrassing. Also I forgot to note
  in the previous entry that I removed the automatic cleanup upon removal of
  this package, because doing that deletes your selection if this package is
  reinstalled or upgraded. (This seems to happen with the lisp overlay’s
  version.)

  eselect-guile-2.0.ebuild, files/guile.eselect, files/guile.eselect.5:
  Primarily a fix in the detection of available implementations.

  25 Aug 2015; Barry Schwartz <sortsmill@crudfactory.com>
  eselect-guile-2.0.ebuild, files/guile.eselect:
  Add an ‘unset’ action that helps avoid leaving a mess behind when this
  package is uninstalled.

  25 Aug 2015; Barry Schwartz <sortsmill@crudfactory.com> files/guile.eselect:
  Now accept "ifunset" as an undocumented and deprecated synonym for
  "--if-unset". This is for compatibility with the lisp overlay.
